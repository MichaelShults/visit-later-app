# Visit Later - A Flask website for QA practice
**Current app version:** `v0.0.5`
 ## What is this project about?
 **Visit Later** is a simple Flask web app for saving and deleting links to visit later.
 
  The app is intentionally kept simple and slightly imperfect to create realistic conditions for practicing QA workflows:
test planning, test design, cross-browser testing, test results tracking and bug reporting.
