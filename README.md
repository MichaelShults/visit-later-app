# Visit Later - A Flask website for QA practice

 ## What is this project about?
- **Visit Later** is Flask web app that tracks urls that you want to visit later. 
It aims to be convenient and user friendly.
You will be able to save any type of link - videos, articles, etc.

**Current app version:** v0.0.3 (in development)

 ### Features that I may add over time:
- Tagging, categorizing, or sectioning
- A daily feed
- Some form of reminders or push notifications
- Some automatic behaviors
    - Auto categorization (Video / article / etc.) 
- The purpose of this project is to help me practice manual and automatic testing.
    - I am keeping the app simple and unpolished on purpose. This leaves room for more bugs for me to find and document.

## Testing Artifacts
I also write test plans, test descriptions. After running through the tests I log the test runs and my findings in a test report. All documents are in Markdown format.


## Bug Reports

I’m logging bugs that I find while testing the app.

- Bug reports are stored in 'bug_logs/'
- Each bug is documented in Markdown, with a clear description, reproduction steps, expected VS actual results and environment info

Current logs:
- BUG-001: "contact us" link url incorrect - FIXED
- BUG-002: '/contact' route returns 404, link exists but page isn't implemented - FIXED
