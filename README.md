# Visit Later - A Flask website for QA practice

 ## **What is this project about?**
- **Visit Later** is flask website that tracks urls that you want to visit later. 
    - It aims to be convienient and user friendly.
    - You will be able to save any type of link - videos, articles, etc.
    - **Features** that I may add over time:
        - Tagging, categorizing, or sectioning
        - A daily feed
        - Some form of reminders or push notifications
        - Some automatic behaviors
            - Auto categorization (Video / article / etc.) 
- **The purpose** of this project is mainly for me to practice manual and automatic testing.
    - Due to that the web app itself probably wouldn't be too complex or polished, this leaves room for bugs to appear, which helps me simulate  testing methodologies.

## Bug Reports

Iâ€™m logging bugs that I find while testing the app.

- Bug reports are stored in 'bug_logs/'
- Each bug is documented carefully in Markdown, with a precise description, reproduction steps, and expected VS actual results

Current logs:
- BUG-001: "contact us" link url incorrect 
- BUG-002: '/contact' route returns 404, link exists but page isn't implemented
