# Visit Later - A Flask website for QA practice

 ## What is this project about?
- **Visit Later** is a simple Flask web app for saving and deleting links to visit later. The project is intentionally simple and imperfect to create realistic conditions for QA practice and bug reporting.

**Current app version:** v0.0.5-pre

## Testing Artifacts
- Test plans (STP)
- Test descriptions (STD)
- Test reports (STR)

## Bug Reports

Iâ€™m logging bugs that I find while testing the app.

- Bug reports are stored in `bug_logs/`.
- Each bug is documented in Markdown, with a clear description, reproduction steps, expected vs actual results and environment info.

Fixed in v0.0.4:
- Bugs 003 - 007: validation and deletion form edge cases.
