**Author**: Michael Shults  
**Date**: 21/06/2025  
**Last Updated**: 11/07/2025  
**App Version**: `v0.0.5-pre` and later versions  
**Spec Version**: 1.1

**Context**: Written after the `v0.0.5-pre` version tag was pushed to GitHub. This document reflects desired specification, and currently not all functionality and UI is implemented according to this spec.
Purpose: Establish ground truth for functionality and UI, to bring clarity to the QA process.

**Description**: 'Visit Later' is a simple flask web app which allows viewing, adding and removing links to websites you might want to visit later.

## UI Layout

## Functionality
### Menu:
When a menu button is clicked:
- 'Home' menu button redirect to the `/` route
- 'About' menu button redirect to the `/about` route

### Links Table:
- Displays all the rows in `database/db.sqlite`. Only the `url` and `title` fields are displayed. `id` should not be displayed to the user.

### Add Link Form:
- The user must fill in both 'Title' and 'URL' to proceed with addition.
- Validation is only fully enforced on the frontend 
    - Bypassing the frontend and sending malformed requests may create unexpected behaviors.
- Rules to enforce:
    - Maximum input size:
        - Title: 300 characters
        - URL: 500 characters
    - Minimum input size:
        - Title: 1 non whitespace character
        - URL: 1 non whitespace character
    - Title and URL cannot be a sequence of whitespace characters. They must contain at least one non whitespace character
    - URL and title are trimmed of leading and trailing whitespaces on the backend.
- Not enforced:
    - URL validation
    - Limits on the allowed characters in the inputs.
    - Sequences of two or more whitespaces in the middle of the string. These may not be rendered correctly, and are not supported by the app. There is no validation for that for now.
- Enforcement methods and validation errors:
    - Input size is enforced with the `maxlength` and `minlength` text input attributes
    - Empty or whitespace only field:
         - should cause the following message to display:
            - "URL cannot be empty" for the URL
            - "Title cannot be empty" for the title
        - Use the browser native validation popups to show the message. They can be triggered by the javascript `input.reportValidity()` method.
            - Since browser allows only one popup at a time, if both fields are empty or are a whitespace sequence, a popup will be displayed just for the title field.   

### Delete Link Form:
- Validation is only fully enforced on the frontend 
    - Bypassing the frontend and sending malformed requests may create unexpected behaviors.
- Rules to enforce:
    - Maximum input size:
        - Title: 300 characters
        - URL: 500 characters
    - 'Delete by field' radio buttons:
        - If 'Title' is selected:
            - 'Title' field must not be empty or a whitespace sequence to proceed with deletion.
            - 'URL' field can be either empty or not, and is ignored on form submission.
            - 'Title' is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespaces on the backend.
        - If 'URL' is selected:
            - 'URL' field must not be empty or a whitespace sequence to proceed with deletion.
            - 'Title' field can be either empty or not, and is ignored on form submission.
            - 'URL' is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespaces on the backend.
        - If 'Title and URL' is selected:
            - 'URL' and 'Title' fields must not be empty or a whitespace sequences to proceed with deletion.
            - 'URL' and 'Title' are trimmed of leading and trailing whitespaces on the backend.
- Not enforced:
    - URL validation
    - Limits on the allowed characters in the inputs.
    - Sequences of two or more whitespaces in the middle of the string may create unexpected behavior.
- If no matching entry exists, the page reloads and no entry is deleted. No message is displayed to the user. 
- Enforcement methods and validation errors:
    - Input size is enforced with the `maxlength` text input attributes
    - Empty or whitespace only field
         - should cause the following message to display:
            - "URL cannot be empty" for the URL (If deletion is by URL)
            - "Title cannot be empty" for the title (If deletion is by Title)
            - "URL cannot be empty" and "Title cannot be empty" (If deletion is by 'Title and URL')
        - Use the browser native validation popups to show the message. They can be triggered by the javascript `input.reportValidity()` method.
            - Each message will be displayed below its respective field.
            - Since browser allows only one popup at a time, if deletion is by 'Title and URL' both fields are empty or are a whitespace sequence, a popup will be displayed just for the title field.
