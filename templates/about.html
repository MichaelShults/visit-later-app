            <div>
                <p> How often do you come across an article, blog post or video you want to check out immediately,
                    but you realize you have some more urgent things to do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might bookmark the page, email or WhatsApp it to yourself or add it to the "Reading List" 
                    some browsers have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what if there were a simple and reliable app just for that?
                </p>
