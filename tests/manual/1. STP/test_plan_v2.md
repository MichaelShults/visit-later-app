## Introduction
This document is an updated and revamped version of 'test_plan_v1.md'. The motivation behind this new version is to increase precision and broaden the scope, so that the plan stays relevant for future versions of the app.

## Objectives

## Features that will be tested
1. Static content and route ('about', 'contact', static content of 'index')
2. Menu and internal links
3. External links to other websites
4. View links list, and add and remove items from it using web forms

## Features that will not be tested
1. Security
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile
