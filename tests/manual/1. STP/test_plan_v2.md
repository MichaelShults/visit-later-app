## Introduction
This document is an updated and revamped version of 'test_plan_v1.md'. The motivation behind this new version is to increase precision and broaden the scope, so that the plan stays relevant for future versions of the app.

## Objectives
The goal is to have a solid test coverage of the website and the main app. Both major and minor bugs should be detected. The website should work smoothly, and the CRUD part of the app should function as expected from a typical user.

## Features that will be tested
1. Static content and route ('about', 'contact', static content of 'index')
2. Menu and internal links
3. External links to other websites
4. Add and remove items from the urls list using web forms

## Features that will not be tested
1. Security
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile
