STD Version: 1.0
Author: Michael Shults
Date: 17/06/2025
Last Updated: 21/06/2025

## Introduction
This STD is about testing the v0.0.5-pre version of our app for regressions. I will also be doing an exploratory testing session, mainly for usability and UI/UX. 
This STD is based on tests/manual/STP/test_plan_v2.md.
Testing results are recorded in tests/manual/STR/STR_v0.0.5.md
Exploratory testing is documented in tests/manual/Exploratory/session-002-usability_UI_UX_v0.0.5.md

## Features that will be tested (STP/test_plan_v2.md)
Static content of 'index' page - #1 in STP
View links list, and add and remove items from it using web forms - #4 in STP


## Static test data for v0.0.5
- **Databases**
    - **TestDatabase:** `database/db.sqlite` 
    - **UnmodifiedDatabase:** `test_databases_read_only/db.sqlite`  
        - **Database Schema:** `(id, URL, Title)`
            - id (autoincrement PK) is present but not visible in UI or used in tests   
        - **Rows:** ("www.google.com","google"), ("www.wikipedia.com", "wikipedia")

## Precondition For TC01 - TC17
To ensure consistent test data between runs, before executing each test case:
1. Delete **TestDatabase**
2. Place an unmodified copy of the file **UnmodifiedDatabase** in place of it.
Alternatively: You can run scripts/reset_test_database.ps1, which does steps 1 and 2 automatically. 
3. All tests assume the browser is open on `localhost:5000`

## Notes on UI changes:
- For clarity, the 'Add URL' and 'Delete URL' buttons were renamed to 'Add Link' and 'Delete Link' respectively.
- Due to added styling with css, the UI is now centered and aligned, and some design elements are applied. However the content and functionality aren't supposed to be any different.
