## Test Data
Test data used here is directly from `STD_v0.0.5-pre.md` or generated with the Python interpreter.
Data from the STD (without the single quotes):
- Titles ('yahoo', 'google', 'wikipedia')
- URLs ('www.yahoo.com', 'www.google.com', 'www.wikipedia.com')
- Empty fields where required by test case
Data generated using the Python interpreter (for test cases TC19, TC20):
- Four strings that consist only of the repeated letter 'a' with varying lengths (300 and 500 characters for TC19, 301 and 501 characters for TC20)
- The strings can be generated by opening the Python interpreter (any version will do), and typing `a * NUM`, where `NUM` is the length of the string. The generated strings can then be copied and pasted in the appropriate fields as defined in test cases TC19, TC20.
