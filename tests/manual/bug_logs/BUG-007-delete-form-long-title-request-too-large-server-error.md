## Bug Title
Deleting by Title with a very long title causes 'Request Entity Too Large' error.

## Summary
Filling a very long string in the Title field for the delete form, selecting 'delete by title', then clicking the 'delete url' button (which submits the form) causes a 'Request entity too large error', instead of giving a clear feedback near the deletion form.

## Steps to Reproduce (Run steps 1-5 with A option, then repeat steps 1-5 with B option):
1. Reset database by running 'reset_test_database.ps1'
2. Navigate to 'localhost:5000'

4. Copy all the text from the file "tests\manual\test_data\very_long_string.txt'
5. Paste it into the 'Title' field
6. Press "Delete URL" to submit the form



**Expected result:**
- The user is not allowed to submit the form if the string is too long
